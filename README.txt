## Manage your mobile workforce

[Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce](https://robertdevore.com/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce/) offers better driver management for all delivery services who use WooCommerce.

Your business benefits from this plugin by giving your drivers the ability to easily connect with both the customer of the order and your dispatch center.

Time saved is money earned.

### Get more done

The Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce plugin helps your business by reducing paperwork, communications and other manual tasks that eat up your time.

### Manage your drivers

This plugin gives you the ability to add new users with the designated `Driver` role to your WordPress site.

Once the driver has been added to your userlist, you can edit orders and assign a specific driver to the order.

### Driver capabilites

Give your drivers the ability to view their assigned orders, mark an order as `Out for Delivery` and then `Completed` after the order has been delivered.

With these capabilities passed along to your drivers, you now have additional time free to manage other areas of your business.
